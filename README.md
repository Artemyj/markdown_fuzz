# markdown_fuzz
Markdown_fuzz is a program which aims to help developers who are developing converters with Markdown to other formats. 
The program reads a text file with a simple text and generates a given amount of output files by inserting a random position of 
each line of output file random element markup. Using this technique can detect defects in the code that lead to falls and eternal cycles

# Usage
Just follow program instructions.

# Prepare a file with the syntax
Just enter one markdown markup element per line in file and save it
